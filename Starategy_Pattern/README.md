# Strategy Pattern

Defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangable.   
This pattern allows us the make "horizontal" reuse of code, instead of vertical (inheritance) - Uses composition rather then inheritance.   
×¥

Example of use of Strategy Pattern: Arrays.sort(). The sorting algorithm can change irrespective of its' user's code.
