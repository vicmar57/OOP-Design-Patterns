while a full line with an empty arrow represents a "has a.." relationship.

### The patterns are accompanied by UML diagrams for easier understanding

A huge thanks to Christopher Okhravi for his amazing design patterns videos (you can watch the series at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9ejT8FO-7I&list=PLrhzvIcii6GNjpARdnO4ueTUAVR9eMBpc ). 
The disscussed patterns are from the book "Head First Design Patterns" by Elisabeth Freeman and Kathy Sierra.
